# my dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. I made them to help me quickly set up Fedora Workstation or macOS.

## How to use this repository

The simplest way is to run these commands:

```shell
# cloning repository
git clone https://github.com/calejvaldez/.dotfiles/
cd .dotfiles

# using the install file
bash ./install.sh
```

This will install the programs I usually use, as well as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extensions that I use.

There's also the `GNOME/DashToPanelSettings`, which is for the [Dash to Panel](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/) GNOME extension. You can just import it through the Dash to Panel settings.
