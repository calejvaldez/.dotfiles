# dotfiles (for Fedora Workstation)

These are my personal dotfiles. As of now, these only work for Fedora Workstation x86_64 and aarch64.

## How to use this repository

The simplest way is to run this command:

```shell
# cloning repository
git clone https://github.com/calejvaldez/.dotfiles/
cd .dotfiles

# using the install file
sudo bash ./install.sh
```

This will install the programs I usually use, as well as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extensions that I use.

Another file is the DashToPanelSettings file, which is for the [Dash to Panel](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/) GNOME extension. You can just import it through the Dash to Panel settings.
